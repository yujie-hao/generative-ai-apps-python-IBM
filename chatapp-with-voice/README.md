  - IBM Watson speech-to-text (STT)
  
    STT is an AI service that converts spoken language into written text using advanced machine learning techniques to for developing applications that require voice input, such as voice-controlled assistants, transcribing meetings, or enhancing customer support with voice commands. In STT, deep neural networks process audio signals to transcribe spoken words into text. These models are trained on diverse datasets, including different languages, accents, and speech in various environments, to improve recognition accuracy and adaptability.
    
    - Key features:
      - Real-time speech recognition: Watson STT can transcribe live audio as it's being spoken, which is crucial for interactive applications. 
      - Language and dialect support: STT supports multiple languages and dialects, making it versatile for global applications. 
      - Customization: Users can train the service with domain-specific terminology and speech patterns, improving accuracy for niche applications.
 
  - IBM Watson text-to-speech (TTS)
    
    TTS complements the STT service by converting written text into natural-sounding spoken audio. Watson's TTS is among the leading services that produce lifelike and expressive voice outputs. TTS technology has evolved from simple, robotic-sounding outputs to generating speech that closely mimics human tones and inflections. This is achieved through advanced deep learning models that understand text context, emotional cues, and linguistic nuances.
    - Key features:
      - Expressive and natural voices: TTS offers a variety of voices and languages that help to deliver output in accordance with user preferences. 
      - Emotion and expressiveness: TTS allows users to control the tone, emotion, and expressiveness of the voice output to suit the context of the conversation. 
      - Customization: Like STT, Watson TTS allows customization of voices and can be trained to include specific jargon or pronunciations unique to a business or industry.
